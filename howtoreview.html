		<h2>How to review</h2>

		<p>We want our teaching materials to be educational, engaging, respectful, and accurate.
		Thus, we want each of them to be reviewed by one content expert (and ideally one who has
		taught the topic themselves), according to our rubric.
		That way, we can help the content creator to improve their materials,
		and we can help other teachers decide which materials to use in their classes.
		</p>

		<p>Here are the steps for reviewing:</p>
		<ul>

			<li>Log into <a href="https://trello.com/b/alrf6b6Q/curriculum-sprint-part-2-review-a-palooza" target="_blank">Trello</a></li>
			<li>Assign yourself to a card under “To Review”</li>
			<li>Move the card to “In Review”</li>
			<li>Open our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zw7qX2EAO08rGAjl9683aVxtsAoZQLxmy7evu2my4OY/edit" target="_blank">Curriculum Review Template</a></li>.
			<li>Click "Make a copy"</li>
			<li>Set permission to “Anyone with link can view”.</li>
			<li>Fill out your copy of the rubric as you review the curriculum. </li>
			<li>When you are done, move your card to the relevant column in Trello and add a comment with a link to your review document</li>
			</li>
		</li>
